OPTIONS:
    -h                   Shows this help.
    -c {width}           Width of resulting image. Has to be positive integer.
                         (default: 1024)
    -r {height}          Height of resulting image. Has to be positive integer.
                         (default: 1024)
    -n {iterations}      Maximum number of iterations for each pixel. Has to be
                         positive integer (default: 2000)
    -o {filename}        Filename of resulting bitmap. (default: ./mandelbrot.bmp)
    -b {blocksize}       Number of rows to be assigned to a slave at once.
                         Has to be smaller than (height/slave-count).
                         Has to be a divisor of height. (default: 1)
    -x {offset}          X-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -y {offset}          Y-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -a {length}          Absolute value range of x/y-axis, e.g. if length was 2, 
                         displayed x/y-values would range from -1 to 1. 
                         If the x/y-offsets are set, axis shifts by those offsets.
                         Negative value inverts axis.
                         Has to be non-zero double value. (default: 2)
    -p {hexnum}          Minimum color of the resulting image. (default: 0x000000)
    -q {hexnum}          Maximum color of the resulting image. (default: 0xffffff)
    -m {hexnum}          Hex mask to manipulate color ranges. (default: 0xffffff)
    -s                   Print progress of the computation.

Error: argument of '-n' has to be greater than zero.

    -b {blocksize}       Number of rows to be assigned to a slave at once.
                         Has to be smaller than (height/slave-count).
                         Has to be a divisor of height. (default: 1)
    -x {offset}          X-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -y {offset}          Y-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -a {length}          Absolute value range of x/y-axis, e.g. if length was 2, 
                         displayed x/y-values would range from -1 to 1. 
                         If the x/y-offsets are set, axis shifts by those offsets.
                         Negative value inverts axis.
                         Has to be non-zero double value. (default: 2)
    -p {hexnum}          Minimum color of the resulting image. (default: 0x000000)
    -q {hexnum}          Maximum color of the resulting image. (default: 0xffffff)
    -m {hexnum}          Hex mask to manipulate color ranges. (default: 0xffffff)
    -s                   Print progress of the computation.

Dynamic MPI mandelbrot algorithm

usage: ./mandelbrot [options]

OPTIONS:
    -h                   Shows this help.
    -c {width}           Width of resulting image. Has to be positive integer.
                         (default: 1024)
    -r {height}          Height of resulting image. Has to be positive integer.
                         (default: 1024)
    -n {iterations}      Maximum number of iterations for each pixel. Has to be
                         positive integer (default: 2000)
    -o {filename}        Filename of resulting bitmap. (default: ./mandelbrot.bmp)
    -b {blocksize}       Number of rows to be assigned to a slave at once.
                         Has to be smaller than (height/slave-count).
                         Has to be a divisor of height. (default: 1)
    -x {offset}          X-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -y {offset}          Y-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -a {length}          Absolute value range of x/y-axis, e.g. if length was 2, 
                         displayed x/y-values would range from -1 to 1.

    -o {filename}        Filename of resulting bitmap. (default: ./mandelbrot.bmp)
    -b {blocksize}       Number of rows to be assigned to a slave at once.
                         Has to be smaller than (height/slave-count).
                         Has to be a divisor of height. (default: 1)
    -x {offset}          X-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -y {offset}          Y-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -a {length}          Absolute value range of x/y-axis, e.g. if length was 2, 
                         displaError: argument of '-n' has to be greater than zero.
yed x/y-values would range from -1 to 1. 
                         If the x/y-offsets are set, axis shifts by those offsets.
                         Negative value inverts axis.
                         Has to be non-zero double value. (default: 2)
    -p {hexnum}          Minimum color of the resulting image. (default: 0x000000)
    -q {hexnum}          Maximum color of the resulting image. (default: 0xffffff)
    -m {hexnum}          Hex mask to manipulate color ranges. (default: 0xffffff)

Dynamic MPI mandelbrot algorithm

usage: ./mandelbrot [options]

OPTIONS:
    -h                   Shows this help.
    -c {width}           Width of resulting image. Has to be positive integer.
                         (default: 1024)
    -r {height}          Height of resulting image. Has to be positive integer.
                         (default: 1024)
    -n {iterations}      Maximum number of iterations for each pixel. Has to be
                         positive integer (default: 2000)
    -o {filename}        Filename of resulting bitmap. (default: ./mandelbrot.bmp)
    -b {blocksize}       Number of rows to be assigned to a slave at once.
                         Has to be smaller than (height/slave-count).
                         Has to be a divisor of height. (default: 1)
    -x {offset}          X-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -y {offset}          Y-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -a {length}          Absolute value range of x/y-axis, e.g. if length was 2, 
                         displaError: argument of '-n' has to be greater than zero.
yed x/y-values would range from -1 to 1. 
                         If the x/y-offsets are set, axis shifts by those offsets.
                         Negative value inverts axis.
                         Has to be non-zero double value. (default: 2)
    -p {hexnum}          Minimum color of the resulting image. (default: 0x000000)
    -q {hexnum}          Maximum color of the resulting image. (default: 0xffffff)
    -m {hexnum}          Hex mask to manipulate color ranges. (default: 0xffffff)
    -s                   Print progress of the computation.

Dynamic MPI mandelbrot algorithm

usage: ./mandelbrot [options]

OPTIONS:
    -h                   Shows this help.
    -c {width}           Width of resulting image. Has to be positive integer.
                         (default: 1024)
    -r {height}          Height of resulting image. Has to be positive integer.
                         (default: 1024)
    -n {iterations}      Maximum number of iterations for each pixel. Has to be
                         positive integer (default: 2000)
    -o {filename}        Filename of resulting bitmap. (default: ./mandelbrot.bmp)
    -b {blocksize}       Number of rows to be assigned to a slave at once.
                         Has to be smaller than (height/slave-count).
                         Has to be a divisor of height. (default: 1)
    -x {offset}          X-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -y {offset}          Y-offset from [0,0]. (default: 0)
    -a {length}          Absolute value range of x/y-axis, e.g. if length was 2, 
                         displayed x/y-values would range from -1 to 1. 
                         If the x/y-offsets are set, axis shifts by those offsets.
                         Negative value inverts axis.
                         Has to be non-zero double value. (default: 2)
    -p {hexnum}          Minimum color of the resulting image. (default: 0x000000)
    -q {hexnum}          Maximum color of the resulting image. (default: 0xffffff)
    -m {hexnum}          Hex mask to manipulate color ranges. (default: 0xffffff)
    -s                   Print progress of the computation.

Error: argument of '-n' has to be greater than zero.

There are not enough slots available in the system to satisfy the 9
slots that were requested by the application:

  ./mandelbrot

Either request fewer slots for your application, or make more slots
available for use.

A "slot" is the Open MPI term for an allocatable unit where we can
launch a process.  The number of slots available are defined by the
environment in which Open MPI processes are run:

  1. Hostfile, via "slots=N" clauses (N defaults to number of
     processor cores if not provided)
  2. The --host command line parameter, via a ":N" suffix on the
     hostname (N defaults to 1 if not provided)
  3. Resource manager (e.g., SLURM, PBS/Torque, LSF, etc.)
  4. If none of a hostfile, the --host command line parameter, or an
     RM is present, Open MPI defaults to the number of processor cores

In all the above cases, if you want Open MPI to default to the number
of hardware threads instead of the number of processor cores, use the
--use-hwthread-cpus option.

Alternatively, you can use the --oversubscribe option to ignore the
number of available slots when deciding the number of processes to
launch.

  ./mandelbrot

Either request fewer slots for your application, or make more slots
available for use.

A "slot" is the Open MPI term for an allocatable unit where we can
launch a process.  The number of slots available are defined by the
environment in which Open MPI processes are run:

  1. Hostfile, via "slots=N" clauses (N defaults to number of
     processor cores if not provided)
  2. The --host command line parameter, via a ":N" suffix on the
     hostname (N defaults to 1 if not provided)
  3. Resource manager (e.g., SLURM, PBS/Torque, LSF, etc.)
  4. If none of a hostfile, the --host command line parameter, or an
     RM is present, Open MPI defaults to the number of processor cores

In all the above cases, if you want Open MPI to default to the number
of hardware threads instead of the number of processor cores, use the
--use-hwthread-cpus option.

Alternatively, you can use the --oversubscribe option to ignore the
number of available slots when deciding the number of processes to
launch.
